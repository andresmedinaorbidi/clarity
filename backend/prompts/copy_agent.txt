PROJECT DETAILS:

- Target Audience: {project_meta}
- User Personas: {ux_strategy}
- High-Fidelity Sitemap: {sitemap}

YOUR MISSION:
Write compelling, conversion-focused marketing copy for each SECTION within each page. The sitemap now includes specific sections (e.g., "Hero", "Features Grid", "Testimonials"). Write targeted copy for each section.

FOCUS ON SECTION-SPECIFIC PERSUASION:
1. What COPY FRAMEWORK should we use? (Problem-Agitation-Solution, Before-After-Bridge, Feature-Advantage-Benefit, etc.)
2. What is the BRAND VOICE? (Professional, friendly, authoritative, playful, inspirational, etc.)
3. For EACH PAGE and EACH SECTION within that page, write:
   - HEADLINE: Section-specific headline that fits the section's purpose (8-12 words)
   - SUBHEADLINE: Supporting text for the section (12-20 words)
   - CTA PRIMARY: Main call-to-action for this section (if applicable)
   - CTA SECONDARY: Secondary CTA if applicable (optional)
   - VALUE PROPS: 2-4 key benefits or points specific to this section

COPYWRITING CONTEXT:
- Use the UX persona's PAIN POINTS to craft empathetic, problem-aware copy
- Use the UX persona's GOALS to highlight aspirational outcomes
- Align with the BRAND POSITIONING to maintain consistent messaging
- Consider the DESIGN STYLE (copy should match the visual tone)
- Think about the USER JOURNEY (where is the user in their decision-making process?)

PROVEN COPYWRITING PRINCIPLES:
- Lead with benefits, not features
- Use active voice and action verbs
- Create urgency where appropriate (without being pushy)
- Address objections preemptively
- Use power words that trigger emotion
- Keep it scannable and concise
- End every section with a clear next step

IMPORTANT:
- Base copy on the actual persona's language and pain points
- Ensure headlines are attention-grabbing AND benefit-driven
- CTAs should be specific and compelling (avoid generic "Click Here")
- Include a "reasoning" field explaining your copy framework and voice choices
- Think like a conversion copywriter focused on engagement and action
- Avoid clichés and corporate jargon - write like you're talking to a real person
