### CRITICAL DATA SOURCES (YOU MUST USE ALL OF THESE):

#### 1. SEO DATA (state.seo_data):
{seo_data}

**SEO IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- Use the EXACT meta title for each page from `page_seo[page_name].meta_title`
- Use the EXACT meta description from `page_seo[page_name].meta_description`
- Implement the focus keyword naturally throughout the content
- Add proper <title>, <meta name="description">, and Open Graph tags
- Use primary and secondary keywords in headings where appropriate
- Add descriptive alt attributes to all images using focus keywords
- Ensure semantic HTML5 structure for SEO (proper heading hierarchy, article tags, etc.)

#### 2. COPYWRITING DATA (state.copywriting):
{copywriting}

**COPYWRITING IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- Use the EXACT headline from `page_copy[page_name].headline` as the primary H1
- Use the EXACT subheadline from `page_copy[page_name].subheadline`
- Implement the PRIMARY CTA using `page_copy[page_name].cta_primary`
- Implement the SECONDARY CTA using `page_copy[page_name].cta_secondary` (if present)
- Display all value propositions from `page_copy[page_name].value_props` prominently
- Match the brand voice tone specified in `brand_voice`
- Follow the copy framework specified in `copy_framework`
- DO NOT rewrite or paraphrase this copy - use it verbatim

#### 3. UX STRATEGY (state.ux_strategy):
{ux_strategy}

**UX IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- Design the layout to address the primary persona's pain points
- Follow the user journey stages from `user_journey` to structure content flow
- Place conversion points from `conversion_points` strategically (CTAs, forms, etc.)
- Prioritize the UX elements listed in `ux_priorities`
- Ensure the design guides users naturally through their decision-making process
- Use visual hierarchy to emphasize conversion-critical elements

#### 4. BUSINESS STRATEGY (state.project_meta):
{project_meta}

**STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- Align the design with the business goals from `business_goals`
- Tailor messaging and visuals for the `target_audience`
- Incorporate the `brand_positioning` statement into the hero section
- Design with the success metrics from `success_metrics` in mind (e.g., if "lead generation" is a metric, make forms prominent)

#### 5. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS (state.prd_document):
{prd_document}

**PRD IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- Follow ALL technical specifications from the PRD strictly
- Implement every section and component mentioned in the PRD
- Respect the information architecture and page structure
- Include all required functionality (forms, navigation, interactive elements)
- Adhere to the design system specifications

#### 6. BRAND IDENTITY:
- Project Name: {project_name}
- Industry: {industry}
- Brand Colors: {brand_colors}
- Design Style: {design_style}

**BRAND IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- Configure Tailwind to use brand colors as primary/secondary theme colors
- Apply the design style consistently (minimalist, modern, playful, etc.)
- Ensure brand name appears prominently in header/nav

### TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
- Generate a SINGLE, COMPLETE HTML FILE
- Include CDN links: Tailwind CSS and Lucide Icons
- Ensure full responsiveness (mobile-first approach)
- Use modern UI patterns: glassmorphism, gradients, smooth animations, grid layouts
- Implement proper semantic HTML5 structure

**TAILWIND CONFIGURATION:**
- Add inline Tailwind config in <script> tag to define brand colors:
  ```
  tailwind.config = {{
    theme: {{
      extend: {{
        colors: {{
          'brand-primary': '{{primary color from brand_colors}}',
          'brand-secondary': '{{secondary color from brand_colors}}'
        }}
      }}
    }}
  }}
  ```
- Use these custom color classes (bg-brand-primary, text-brand-secondary, etc.) throughout

**CODE QUALITY STANDARDS:**
- Write clean, well-structured HTML with proper indentation
- Use Tailwind utility classes exclusively (no custom CSS)
- Ensure accessibility: ARIA labels, semantic tags, keyboard navigation
- Optimize for performance: lazy loading images, efficient DOM structure
- Include smooth scroll behavior and subtle animations
