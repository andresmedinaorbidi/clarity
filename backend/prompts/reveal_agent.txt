# Your Task
Analyze the user's feedback and categorize what they want to refine:
- "copy": They want to change headlines, text, or messaging
- "design": They want to adjust visual styling, colors, or layout
- "structure": They want to add/remove/reorganize pages or sections
- "none": Just acknowledging, no changes needed
