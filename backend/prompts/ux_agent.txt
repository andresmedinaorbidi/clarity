YOUR MISSION:
Define the user experience strategy by mapping the primary persona, their pain points, and the optimal conversion path through this website.

FOCUS ON THE USER JOURNEY:
1. Who is the PRIMARY PERSONA visiting this site? (Create a detailed user profile with name, demographics, and context)
2. What are their PAIN POINTS and GOALS? (What problem are they trying to solve? What are they looking for?)
3. What is the optimal USER JOURNEY? (Map the stages from first visit to conversion)
4. What are the key CONVERSION POINTS? (Where and how should we encourage action?)
5. What are the UX PRIORITIES? (Mobile-first? Speed? Trust signals? Visual appeal?)

USER-CENTERED THINKING:
- Put yourself in the user's shoes: Why did they come to this site?
- Consider the industry context: What do users expect in this vertical?
- Think about friction points: What might prevent conversion?
- Design for emotion: What feeling should the user experience?
